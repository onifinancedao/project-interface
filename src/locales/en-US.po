To achieve this, the project allows users to mint OFP tokens in exchange for USDC tokens, each of which entitles them to one vote in the project's governance system. A total of 20000 OFP tokens will be allowed to be minted, and once minted, seven decentralized raffles will take place, each with different USDC token prizes. There will also be a community raffle on Twitter with 50 prizes of 1000 USDC tokens each. Users will be able to claim OFI tokens in exchange for their OFP tokens 60 days after the launch of the Onifinance DAO, and in case of emergency, the project has a mechanism to distribute the OFP contract balance among holders in exchange for their OFP tokens."
